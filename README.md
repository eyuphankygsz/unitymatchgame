# Unity Match Game

Hi everyone! this is my first game project ON GITHUB!

# About This Game:
It is a simple match game made in Unity Game Engine!
You basically find the matching objects next to eachother and explode them.
Everytime you explode objects, some new objects will spawn top of the game area.
So it has infinite loop.


I wrote my own "flood fill" algorithm  and code in this game.
I used recursive loops and many other things!

Please download and use this project for feedback and personal learning, not for commercial purposes.
